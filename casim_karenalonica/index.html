        <h2>Karen Alonica's Journal</h2>
        <p>As the year comes to an end, I welcome you to spend a few minutes
				reading this brief first entry in my journal. A journal laced
				with honesty but concealing a reality too personal to discuss
				freely. Please allow me to introduce myself: Karen Alonica.
				Letâ€™s start with, how I spend my childhood lifestyle that put
				me to decide what I really want to involve myself.</p>
		<p>Let me begin with my childhood when my passions began to influence
				my decisions. Like any other kid, I enjoyed spending time
				outside with other kids. But then something happened. Before
				first grade, I found myself isolating, immersing myself in
				household chores and the world of books. Amidst this, I
				discovered a love for solving puzzles, especially Sudoku, and
				developed a fascination for 'amazing' discoveries. Well, at
				the time I am still in my elementary, so everything feels so
				amazing.</p>
        <p>I was frequently commended for my ability to convey my thoughts
				and opinions while still in elementary school. While my
				friends complained about writing, I stood out for my
				enthusiasm to write and share my opinions and knowledge. In
				sixth grade, I explored genres other than science and
				mathematics, writing down every plot and scenario that
				crossed my mind</p>
		<p>When thinking about my future studies, my interests took a detour.
				My mother's rejection encouraged me to consider psychology
				when I was initially drawn to literature or mathematics.
				This interest stemmed from my early exposure to family
				problems, which prompted me to pay close attention to facial
				expressions and body language. Because I was socially awkward
				and was unable to immerse myself in events, I relied on
				others' behaviors and narratives to comprehend feelings.</p>
        <p>In the year before college, the onset of a pandemic disturbed the
				normal pace of life. I felt weary after being forced to spend
				so much time with my family, losing motivation to think
				critically or pursue knowledge. My mother was violently
				opposed to my interests in literature, psychology, and
				politics. Instead, she urged me to choose a nearby university
				for practical reasons and opt for a program with mathematics.
				Despite the limited program options, I enrolled at PUP-Taguig
				in Information Technology. Overcoming coding obstacles brought
				me unexpected joy, but the initial joy of success was
				overwhelmed by personal situations, leading to self-doubt
				about continuing in this field. Despite my doubts, I decided
				to carry on, inspired by a sense of obligation to my parents
				and a deeper desire to avoid disappointment in myself. The path
				I've chosen may be difficult, but I see it as one I must
				accomplish.</p>
        <p>Looking ahead, I envision myself still studying and working in
				five years. The setbacks haven't stopped me from fantasizing
				about a future in which I can pursue my true passions. Given
				the challenges of our country's current job market, the
				specifics of my future work remain unknown. Nonetheless, I
				stay hoping for opportunities to make my dreams a reality.</p>
        <p>All I can say is that life is full of chances, and how we take
				advantage of them determines our level of success. I chose to
				walk till I crossed the finish line, facing the uncertainty
				with courage and optimism.</p>
